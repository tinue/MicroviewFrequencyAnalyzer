Microview Frequency Analyzer
============================

As a first project for my new Microview Arduino I wanted to produce a simple
frequency analyzer. It's just a piece of fun, and most of the work was even
done by other people:
a) The Fast Fourier Transform library: http://wiki.openmusiclabs.com/wiki/ArduinoFFT
b) Analysis about the Arduino's sampling capabilities:
    http://www.microsmart.co.za/technical/2014/03/01/advanced-arduino-adc/

Nevertheless, it was an interesting little project. Because I have been asked
about the source code, I placed it on Github.

Any explanation about parts, wiring etc. is in the source code
in the form of comments.

There is a short demonstration video here:
